## About The Project

DermaClust is a dual-model recommendation engine designed to demystify the process of choosing the right skincare products. It leverages two distinct machine learning models:

1.  **CNN for Skin Analysis:** A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on thousands of skin images to classify the user's skin concern into one of five categories: `acne`, `dry`, `oily`, `wrinkles`, or `normal`.
2.  **Transformer for Ingredient Analysis:** A BERT-style Transformer model that processes a product's ingredient list to understand its suitability for different skin types, identifying key active ingredients and potential irritants.

The Streamlit-based web application provides a simple interface for users to upload a photo of their skin and receive tailored product recommendations from a comprehensive database.
